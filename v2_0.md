## Release 2.0

Version 2.0 of [Soszjal bot](index) introduces a concept of 'default channel' (default group conversation).

**TL;DR**

It allows to subscribe to notifications in private conversation with a bot, so please start using it not to create unwanted traffic on SMT Soszjal!

### Longer story

Version 1.0 forced to start subscription on a group channel, to identify which of the channels supported by Soszjal bot the subscription relates to.
In order to get rid of this constraint, which caused unwanted additional traffic on the channel, there is a concept of default channel.

Each user has their default channel which is set up whenever user writes a message to bot on one of configured channels (group conversations).
There is also "global default channel" - set up to SMT Soszjal channel - which is used before first message on any configured channels.

So effectively, members of SMT Soszjal can start talking with bot privately about all function available.

Still, it's possible to set up other channels (as we did for testing purposes), enjoying there similar level of freedom to talk with bot privately -
but after switching their default channel giving some command on their channel (e.g. 'pokaż dostępne powiadomienia').

### Thanks
